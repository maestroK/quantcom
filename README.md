# Quantum Coding Exploration with Qiskit

Welcome to my quantum coding journey using Qiskit! This repository contains my initial attempts at coding in Qiskit as I embark on the exciting path of quantum algorithm research. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, experiments, and the quantum programs I create.

## Getting Started

To dive into the code and experiments, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) library installed. You can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install qiskit
  ```

## Code Overview

- **Experiment 1: Quantum Hello World**
  - A simple quantum circuit to get started.

- **Experiment 2: Entanglement Exploration**
  - Exploring the fascinating world of quantum entanglement.

- **Experiment 3: Quantum Gates Playground**
  - Trying out different quantum gates and their effects.
